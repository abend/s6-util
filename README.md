#s6-util

## Synopsis

Some basic classes that can be used in multiple applications. It may appear to be a somewhat strange assortment of odds-and-ends, but much of that is used in s6-db and is therefore dependent on them.

## Code Example

Coming Soon

## Installation

Include the following in your maven project

    <dependency>
       <groupId>com.samsix</groupId>

You can create a source jar

## Tests

Sadly, no tests at present as I never moved them out of the project they were in to this Open Source Project.
